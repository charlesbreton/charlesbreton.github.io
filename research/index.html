<h2>National Identity and Immigration Attitudes</h2>

<p>When it comes to the impact of national identity on attitudes towards immigration and multiculturalism, there are at least two accepted but competing hypotheses. 
The first, based on research in Europe and in the U.S., is that national identities always act as exclusionary forces: they make people more opposed to immigration and to newcomers. 
This means, for instance, that people for whom national identity is important are more opposed to immigration.  
it also means that making salient the national identity of individuals will increase this opposition. </p> 

<p>The second hypothesis is that Canada has been impervious to a backlash against immigration and multiculturalism observed elsewhere 
because immigration and multiculturalism are founding elements of its national identity.</p>

Using Canada as a case, I stack these two competing hypotheses against each other and test the possibility that some 
national identities might represent an inclusive force.
