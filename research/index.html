<h2>National Identity and Immigration Attitudes</h2>

<p>There are two competing hypotheses about the impact of national identity on attitudes towards immigration.  
The first, based on research in Europe and in the U.S., is that national identities act as exclusionary forces: they make people more opposed to immigration. 
This means, for instance, that making salient the national identity of individuals will increase their opposition to immigration.
The second hypothesis is that a national identity can be made to be inclusive if immigration is built into one of its
founding elements.</p>

Using Canada as a case, I stack these two competing hypotheses against each other and test the possibility that some 
national identities might represent an inclusive force.

<h2>Social Desirability Bias</h2>

<p>In survey research, social desirability bias - as the name indicates - is seen as a nuisance that needs to be circumvented.
When measuring attitudes on sensitive issues, prejudice for instance, researchers use different techniques to overcome the fact that
people might hide their true feelings. But what if this bias was actually measuring something of interest?
</p>

<p>The argument that I develop with my colleague Gregory Eady is that we can gain some insight by studying social desirability bias - or more crudely, lying - as the outcome of interest.
Why do people lie about prejudice toward some groups more than others? How does lying vary with context? In the process, we put forward
a new understanding of social desirability bias as well as new tools to study it.</p>

<h2>Incorporation Policies and Attitudes</h2>

<h2>Conservatism in Canada</h2>

<p>In a previous academic endeavor I studied Moral Conservatism in Canada – or in more easily understandable/less 
exact terms, the Canadian religious right.</p>
