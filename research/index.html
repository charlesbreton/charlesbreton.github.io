<h2>National Identity and Immigration Attitudes</h2>

<p>There are two competing hypotheses about the impact of national identity on attitudes towards immigration.  
The first, based on research in Europe and in the U.S., is that national identities act as exclusionary forces: they make people more opposed to immigration. 
This means, for instance, that making salient the national identity of individuals will increase their opposition to immigration.
The second hypothesis is that a national identity can be made to be inclusive if immigration is built into one of its
founding elements.</p>

Using Canada as a case, I stack these two competing hypotheses against each other and test the possibility that some 
national identities might represent an inclusive force.

<h2>Social Desirability Bias as an Object of Research</h2>

<p>In survey research, social desirability bias&mdashas the name indicates&mdash is seen as a nuisance that needs to be eliminated.
When measuring attitudes on sensitive issues, prejudice for instance, researchers use different techniques to overcome the fact that
people might hide their true attitudes. But what if this bias was actually measuring something of interest?

<h2>Conservatism in Canada</h2>

<p>In a previous academic endeavor I studied Moral Conservatism in Canada â€“ or in more easily understandable/less 
exact terms, the Canadian religious right.</p>
