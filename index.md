I am a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/" class="external"> Vanderbilt University</a>. I received 
my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/" class="external">Department of Political Science</a> at the University of British Columbia.

My areas of research include political psychology and political behavior, issues surrounding immigration and 
ethnic diversity as well as Canadian politics. And important part of my research looks at social norms and at how they affect intergroup attitudes in the context of immigration countries. Questions like what does it *mean* to be Canadian or to be a Québécois touch on the normative aspects of national identity and depending on the answer, these national identities will have different impact on attitudes toward immigration and diversity. 

In the same vein, one stream of my research looks at when and why people are willing to share their prejudice toward ethnic minorities and when they are not. The *strength* of the social norms that incites people to lie about their prejudice varies based on who the group is and based on the circumstances in which the question is asked. 
    
Methodologically, my work is mostly quantitative and is based both on observational and experimental data. I have designed and conducted several large-scale surveys and survey experiments and I am now integrating experiments that take place in a lab setting into my current projects.
