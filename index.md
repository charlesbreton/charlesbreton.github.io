I am a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/" class="external"> Vanderbilt University </a>. I received 
my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/" class="external">Department of Political Science</a> at the University of British Columbia.

My areas of research include political psychology, political behavior, issues surrounding immigration and 
ethnic diversity as well as Canadian politics. I am interested in the role that policies play in intergroup attitudes, especially as it pertains to immigration. 
Indirectly, these policies can also affect social norms.
    
    
Methodologically, my work is mostly quantitative and is based both on observational and experimental data. I have designed and conducted several large-scale surveys and survey experiments and I am now integrating experiments that take place in a lab setting to my research designs.
