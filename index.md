I am a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/" class="external"> Vanderbilt University</a>. I received 
my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at the <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/" class="external">University of British Columbia</a>.

My areas of research include political psychology and political behavior, issues surrounding immigration and 
ethnic diversity as well as Canadian politics. 

Methodologically, my work is mostly quantitative and is based both on observational and experimental data. I have designed and conducted several large-scale surveys and survey experiments and I am now integrating experiments that take place in a lab setting into my current projects.
