I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Political Science at the <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/" class="external">University of British Columbia</a> and for the <a href="http://ces-eec.arts.ubc.ca/" class="external">Canadian Election Study</a>. Prior to this position, I was a SSHRC postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Political Science at 
<a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/" class="external"> Vanderbilt University</a> where I was affiliated with the 
<a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/rips/" class="external"> Research on Individuals, Politics & Society</a> lab.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at the <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/" class="external">University of British Columbia</a> in January 2015.

My main areas of specialization are in political psychology and public opinion with a focus on Canada and on issues surrounding immigration and ethnic diversity. One central theme in my research is the focus on the role played by context in the formation of intergroup attitudes and behaviors. This context can take the form of policies governing over certain relationships - integration policies and immigration for instance - but can also be given by social norms and their cues on accepted attitudes and behaviors.     

Methodologically, my work is quantitative and is based both on observational and experimental data. Most of my work uses original data from several large-scale surveys and survey experiments that I have designed and conducted myself or in collaboration with colleagues.
