<h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Poli492-2013-14.pdf" class="external">Honours Thesis Seminar</a></h2>

<p>This class was taught during the 2013-2014 academic year in collaboration with 
Pr. <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/about-us/faculty-members/bfont-color-blue-full-time-facultyfontb/antje-ellermann.html" class="external">Antje Ellermann</a>. 
It serves as the final class in the <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/undergraduate/program-information/honours-requirements.html" class="external">Honours program</a> at UBC.</p> 

<p> The class consists in a series of lectures on research methods, after which students embark on their own research project. 
Throughout the remainder of the year students present their progress to their colleagues and meet individually with their 
assigned instructor and co-instructor.</p>

<p>I created two documents (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Tools-Honours.pdf" class="external">Tools</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Datasets.pdf" class="external">Datasets</a>) with the goal of helping students start this long project on the right foot. 
Although these documents are intended primarily for students writing a quantitative thesis, 
it could also be useful for other types of research.</p>

<h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Poli110-2012-2013.pdf" class="external">Investigating Politics: An Introduction to Scientific Political Analysis</a></h2>

<p>I participated in the design/elaboration as well as the teaching of this new first year course. 
The goal was to prepare students to engage with the field of political science by introducing them to the basic logic 
and tools used by political scientists to understand and explain the political world. More precisely, 
the idea is to teach students how political scientists ask answerable questions; how we define key political concepts; 
how we formulate hypotheses and theories about political dynamics; how we measure the phenomena we want to study; 
how we think about and assess relationships of cause-and-effect; and how we report our findings to the world.</p>

The course was launched in September 2012 and the work was done in collaboration with Beth Schwartz, Andrea Nuesser,
