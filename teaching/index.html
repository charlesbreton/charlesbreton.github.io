<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Poli492-2013-14.pdf" class="external">Honours Thesis Seminar</a></h3>

<p>This class was taught during the 2013-2014 academic year in collaboration with Pr. <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/about-us/faculty-members/bfont-color-blue-full-time-facultyfontb/antje-ellermann.html" class="external">Antje Ellermann</a>. It serves as the final class in the <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/undergraduate/program-information/honours-requirements.html" class="external">Honours program</a> at UBC.</p> 

<p> The class consists in a series of lectures on research methods, after which students embark on their own research project. Throughout the remainder of the year students present their progress to their colleagues and meet individually with their assigned instructor and co-instructor.</p>

<p>I created two documents (Tools and Datasets) with the goal of helping students start this long project on the right foot. 
Although these documents intended primarily for those students, it could be useful for other students too. You can find more details about them in the Resource section.</p>
