<h3>Honours Thesis Seminar</h3>

This class was taught during the 2013-2014 academic year in collaboration with Pr. <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/about-us/faculty-members/bfont-color-blue-full-time-facultyfontb/antje-ellermann.html">Antje Ellermann</a>.

<p>It serves as the final class in the Honours program at UBC. After a series of lectures on research methods, students embark on their own research project and present their progress to their colleagues every three weeks.</p>
<p>I created two documents to help students writing a quantitative thesis. Although it is intended primarily for those students, it could be useful for other students too.</p>
<h4>Tools and Sources for Quantitative research</h4>
<p>The first document lists a series of tools and articles that can help both in organizing such a long project and in conducting the analysis.</p>
