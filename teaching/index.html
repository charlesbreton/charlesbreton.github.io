<h1>Honours Thesis Seminar</h1>

This class was taught during the 2013-2014 academic year in collaboration with Prof. <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/about-us/faculty-members/bfont-color-blue-full-time-facultyfontb/antje-ellermann.html>Antje Ellermann</a>.

To help students through their projects, I created documents that will hopefully be useful for students doing a quantitative thesis (and possibly other students too!).
