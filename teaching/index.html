<h3>Honours Thesis Seminar</h3>

<p>This class was taught during the 2013-2014 academic year in collaboration with Pr. <a href="http://www.politics.ubc.ca/about-us/faculty-members/bfont-color-blue-full-time-facultyfontb/antje-ellermann.html" class="external">Antje Ellermann</a>. It serves as the final class in the Honours program at UBC.</p> 

<p> The class consists in a series of lectures on research methods, after which students embark on their own research project. Throughout the remainder of the year students present their progress to their colleagues and meet individually with their assigned instructor and co-instructor.</p>


<p>I created two documents to help students writing a quantitative thesis. Although it is intended primarily for those students, it could be useful for other students too.</p>
<h4>Tools and Sources for Quantitative research</h4>
<p>The first document lists a series of tools and articles that can help both in organizing such a long project and in conducting the analysis.</p>
