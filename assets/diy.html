How is this website done?


<p>I was dissatisfied with my Wordpress website and with my hosting company and wanted to start anew. On top of that, I didn't know much about html, 
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="external">Markdown</a>, or<a href="https://github.com/" class="external">GitHub</a> and I wanted to learn. 
In other words, the idea was to kill many birds with one stone: get a new website and learn many things I wanted to learn in the process. Hopefully, this can help people 
in my situation get started.</p>

<p> Why this particular setup? Using GitHub means that you get free hosting but also that you have access to all the perks of 
using it for version control. Website hosted on Github a built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" class="external">Jekyll</a> and many Jekyll themes are available. 
This website uses the <a href="http://www.jekyllnow.com/" class="external">Jekyll Now</a> theme but I customized it considerably. 
I based this customization on two academic website that I think have great layout: Kieran Healy (who does a lot of cool stuff as you can see) and Sean Anderson. This website is somewhat
simpler than theirs so feel free to fork my github repository if you'd like to play around with it. And please, don't laugh
at my inefficient html and css.</p>
