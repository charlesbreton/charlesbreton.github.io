How is this website done? I didn't know much about html when I started so the different Jekyll theme were really
useful. This website uses the Jekyll Now theme but I customized it considerably. Two academic website with great layouts
inspired this one: Kieran Healy (who does a lot of cool stuff as you can see) and Sean Anderson. This website is somewhat
simpler than theirs so feel free to fork my github repository if you'd like to play around with it. And please, don't laugh
at my inefficient html and css.
