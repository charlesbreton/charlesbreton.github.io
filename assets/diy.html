How is this website done?

I didn't know much about html when I started and I wanted to learn so the combination of Jekyll and GitHub (which I also wanted to learn how to use),
proved quite useful. In other words, the idea was to kill two birds with one stone: get a new website and learn in the process.

Using Jekyll means that you have access to themes were really. This website uses the Jekyll Now theme but I customized it considerably. Two academic website with great layouts
inspired this one: Kieran Healy (who does a lot of cool stuff as you can see) and Sean Anderson. This website is somewhat
simpler than theirs so feel free to fork my github repository if you'd like to play around with it. And please, don't laugh
at my inefficient html and css.
