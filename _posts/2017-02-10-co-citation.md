title: The Evolution of Canadian Political Science through Co-Citation Networks.
---

How has Canadian political science evolved since 1968, the first year that the Canadian Journal of Political Science was published in its "modern" format? One way to answer this question is to look at what people are talking about in CJPS, who are they talking with, and perhaps what they are *not* talking about.

Before going further, I want to give credit where it's due. The following was inspired by similar projects done by Kieran Healy about Philosophy and Neal Caren in Sociology.  

Here's the idea. 

Let's assume that what is published in CJPS is what Canadian political scientists are talking about and that who these pieces cite is a reflection of these debates. Let's also assume that papers (books or articles) that are often cited together are addressing the same issue. Looking at how these co-citation networks evolved through time could help us shed light on the evolution of Canadian political science as a field.

## Data

The starting point is everything that has been published in CJPS from 1968 to 2017. Using Carens python script, I then create a dataset containing all the sources that were cited by these articles. These sources can be books or articles.
