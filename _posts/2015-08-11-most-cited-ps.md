title: Most cited article in political science by decade
---

I was inspired to do this by [Kieran Healy](http://kieranhealy.org). By inspired I mean he did it for Sociology using data from a colleague and I decided to do the same with Political Science. I even replicated his graph (as much as I could, Greg Eady helped me with the legend).

Here are the top 10 Political Science articles by decade. To be clear, these are the most-cited articles from that particular decade, not those who were the most cited back then.

The data come from the Web of Science database. These results were obtained by searching the "Political Science" and the "International Relations" categories. One important thing to note is that WofS is more conservative in terms of citation count than Google Scholar and that the same exercise done with the latter would probably look quite different.

Some notable articles just missed the cut. For example, Rawls’s “Justice as Fairness” misses the cut for the 1980s by 3 citations. Get on it theorists.
